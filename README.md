# Autonomous Vehicle Arduino Robot

## Overview
Welcome to the Autonomous Vehicle repository! This project was developed during an exhilarating hackathon, where we combined our passion for robotics, coding, and innovation to create an autonomous vehicle using an Arduino.

## Features
- **Autonomous Navigation:** Our robot utilizes sensors to autonomously navigate its environment, making decisions in real-time.
- **Obstacle Avoidance:** With obstacle detection, our robot can maneuver through challenging environments.
  
## Components
- Arduino Uno: The brain of our robot, responsible for processing sensor data and controlling actuators.
- Ultrasonic Sensors: Used for obstacle detection and avoidance.
- Infrared Sensors: Used for detecting black tape under the robot.
- Motor Drivers: Control the movement of motors for navigation.
- Chassis and Wheels: Provides the physical structure and mobility for the robot.
